# Verbatim frontend

## Description

This repository houses the front-end code for our project.

## Architecture

In this project, we've chosen Flutter as our front-end technology stack.

## Setup

Here are the steps to follow in order to run the initial 'Verbatim Frontend' code:

#### For VS Code

1. Clone the 'verbatim_front-end' repository.
2. Change the directory to your project location.
3. With the backend server running, run the command flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
4. Select the chrome option. Your application should open in Chrome and if you click the plus icon, Hello World should appear.

## Development Testing 
To run dev frontend on a realistic phone for mac/iOS:
1. make sure you have Xcode downloaded and installed and have at least one mobile emulator downloaded
2. type "simulator" into your spotlight search and hit enter (it will bring up your default emulator) and navigate to safari on the emulator
3. run the frontend with flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000 
4. copy and paste the url from chrome (http://localhost:3000/) into the emulator's safari browser

## Deployment

The frontend is deployed via Firebase.
