# Verbatim frontend

## Description

This repository houses the front-end code for our project.

## Architecture

In this project, we've chosen Flutter as our front-end technology stack.

## Setup

Here are the steps to follow in order to run the initial 'Verbatim Frontend' code:

#### For VS Code

1. Clone the 'verbatim_front-end' repository.
2. Change the directory to your project location.
3. With the backend server running, run the command flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
4. Select the chrome option. Your application should open in Chrome and if you click the plus icon, Hello World should appear.


## Deployment

This is still something we need to figure out.
